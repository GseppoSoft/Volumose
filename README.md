# Volumose
Terminal Based Volume Calculator written in C++


Ladies and Gentlemen, I am proud to release ***Volumose***, the Second (Technically first but forgot to release) piece of software by the GseppoSoft group
unlike [PyleManager](https://github.com/GseppoSoft/PyleManager) Volumose is written in C++ and is aa terminal app with no GUI. It calculates based of course on Height, Width, and Length
and is accurate (thanks to C++ knowing how math works) want to know the volume of a 2001 Toyota Camry? Input the internal dimensions of the car and you'll know just how much space you have for your Snapple Collection.

This software will likely not recieve more releases (Seeing as all it has to do is Calculate Volume) However if a user wants to add a feature (like telling the software what you're finding the volume of)
they may feel free so long as they make a pull request and add this feature to the original software.

Please Enjoy from the Folks at GseppoSoft
